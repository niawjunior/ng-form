## Git Flow

### Feature Branch > Dev Branch > Master Branch

- When you have a new feature. you will need to create a new branch And develop from that branch (base on master) `git checkout -b 'new feature'`
- If done. you need to push to that branch `git push -u origin 'new feature'`
- Then, use a development branch for testing `git checkout dev`
- And then, pull the last of code from the feature branch `git pull origin 'new feature'`
- If, your testing passed and no conflict. you can push the code to the development branch `git push origin 'dev branch'`
- And then, you can create a pull request for merge development with the master branch
- Finally, Compare development & master branch if no conflict. And then please review code (comment) and merged
